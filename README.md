# App Development using React native

## Setup

1. Install expo. Expo is a tool for quickly developing React Native Applications quickly.   
`npm install -g expo-cli`

2. Create your project. Expo allows you to either create a blank new project or create a project with some common basic functionality.   
`expo init [YOUR PROJECT NAME]`
3. Develop in the folder expo generates for your project.
4. Test your code using `npm start` and using the Expo app on your mobile device.

## Assignment
Create a React Native App and post it to Github. As long as it works on your phone, do as little or as much as you like.
